# Policy Packs

This document describes how to use Pulumi Premium Policies. It should help you getting started in
creating your first Policy Pack using Pulumi Premium Policies.

In the future, this document won't be necessary when Pulumi Premium Policies are integrated into [`templates-policy`](https://github.com/pulumi/templates-policy).

## Development status

Pulumi Premium Policies are under heavy development and are not meant to be used in a production environment.

## Creating a Policy Pack

Pulumi Premium Policies are hosted in a private package registry and thus require some specific settings.
