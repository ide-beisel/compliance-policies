# Pulumi Compliance-Ready Policies

This repository contains a growing set of Compliance Policies to validate your infrastructure using
Pulumi's Crossguard Policy-as-Code framework.

These policies make it easy to create policy packs for enforcing common security and compliance policies (PCI DSS, ISO 27001 and CIS) across a broad range of cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Kubernetes), and dozens of services within each platform.
